Well it's time to get a notebook, considering that I've mainly only been a desktop user and picking the correct one is harder than previously anticipated.<br />
Inevitably it's impossible to get the 'perfect notebook' so choosing what features are the most important, might give a better idea.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>A CPU with performance equal to an i5 or i7</li>
	<li>Good keyboard, if I need to program I don't wanna waste my time on a cheap membrane keyboard</li>
	<li>At least 1080p display(seriously it's 2014), would prefer an IPS screen</li>
	<li>A display between 13,3" and 15,6""</li>
	<li>A 256gb or 512gb SSD, if necessary I'll buy one separately</li>
	<li>Reasonably light and thin</li>
	<li>Don't care that much about battery life, so 4 hours</li>
	<li>At least 1 USB 3.0</li>
	<li>A touchscreen would be nice, but if another notebook has noticeably better specs I'd prefer that</li>
	<li>My budget is pretty much limitless, as long as it's worth it</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering this is going to used for programming I'm considering doing with a Macbook just to use xcode to develop iOS apps. However if possible I'd rather make my desktop a hackintosh.<br />
<br />
So far the best and most appealing option I've found is the 'Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga'.<br />
I've never been very fond of the Thinkpad brand, since it's more of a business brand. The internet do claim that the keyboard is great with a very tactile feel, good performance, 1080p IPS...bla bal bla, However it does have a 12,5" screen which does seem a bit small.<br />
I'll defiantly try to get a hands on it, before buying it and see if it's any good.</p>
