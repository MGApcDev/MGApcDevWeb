<p>For those running Drupal and who don't know what&nbsp;Drush is a simple beginners guide can be found <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-beginner-s-guide-to-drush-the-drupal-shell"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now those running Drupal 8 will find that only Drush 8 and Drush 9 are compatible. And more importantly you'll need to be running at least PHP 5.4.5 to be running Drush 8</p>

<p>For most this will not be a problem, but for certain reasons Bluehost has hidden their PHP 5.6 a little.</p>

<p>To install Drush you'll need Composer, so this article is a follow up to&nbsp;<a href="http://avantidevelopment.com/install-composer-on-bluehost/"">Install Composer on Bluehost on&nbsp;Avanti Development</a>.</p>

<p>Following his steps you should be able to get composer up and running, but composer only requires PHP 5.4+ and PHP 5.6 is hidden somewhere else.</p>

<p>For this tutorial we'll be installing Drush in the user directory, but you can place it somewhere else if you want.</p>
