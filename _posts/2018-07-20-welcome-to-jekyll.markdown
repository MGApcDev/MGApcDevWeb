You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rawgit.com/MGApcDev/TypesetBot/master/dist/typesetbot.min.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://rawgit.com/MGApcDev/TypesetBot/master/dist/typesetbot.js"></script>

<!-- (optional) -->
<!-- hyphenation library -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/bramstein/hypher/v0.2.5/dist/jquery.hypher.js"></script>
<!-- hyphenation pattern for US english -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/bramstein/hyphenation-patterns/dc01d58a/dist/browser/en-us.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
