<p>With Word being regarded as the literal devil by universities (and with good reason), alternatives providing consistent output with high quality typesetting are quite popular.<br />
LaTex now being the standard was originally released in 1985, and it's issues and limitations are starting to show.<br />
Most notable LaTex's typesetting is just really good, but what constitutes high quality typesetting?</p>

<ul>
	<li>All lines being equally long</li>
	<li>Only hyphenate word when absolutely necessary, adjust text spacing instead</li>
	<li>A lot of content is small area, without making it unreadable.</li>
	<li>Consistent layout for references, footnotes</li>
	<li>Support for correctly displaying mathematical signs</li>
	<li>Consistent style for titles</li>
	<li>Easy to read, recognizable font</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m currently working on a project requiring near perfect typesetting, but can we do more?<br />
...I don’t know, I’m not specialist with typesetting, yet.</p>
