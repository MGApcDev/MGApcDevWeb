<p>Realizing that some of my projects might actually have some value and be worth working on with multiple developers, I've decided to move some of my projects under an organization name on GitHub as&nbsp;<a href=""https://github.com/CoffeeIO"">CoffeeIO</a>. Nothing will change in the code, but this will make it easier to add developers and selling software under a company name.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The website is still under construction and we'll experiment with building it on AWS: <a href=""http://www.coffeeio.com/"">CoffeeIO.com/</a>.</p>
